		<p>The Family Life Center of Auglaize County is a Christ-centered ministry that provides education and services to support the sanctity of human life.  We have two locations in Auglaize county.  We are located on 104 W. Spring Street in St. Marys and 116 E. Auglaize Street Suite B in Wapakoneta.  We are a non-profit pregnancy center fully funded by churches, local businesses, civic and fraternal, and individuals.  All of our services are free and confidential.  These services include: pregnancy tests, limited ultrasounds, and STD testing for both men and women. We offer pregnancy, parenting, life skill classes and bible studies. This allows clients to take classes that apply to their specific season in life.  As they complete classes, they earn store credit which can be used on any item in our Baby Boutique, even diapers.  In our Baby Boutique we sell gently used childrens and maternity clothes, as well as toys and baby essentials.  Anyone is welcome to shop in our boutique, there are no income guidelines. Follow us on Facebook at Family Life Center of Auglaize County to see our upcoming events and stay in touch.
